## Excluded Content (removed during migration)
- Designers page (outdated Figma instructions)
- Engineers page (language-specific content)
- Component Conventions (moved to in-repo docs)
- Component Page Template (enforced via Sanity CMS)
- Writing Conventions (low viewership, better as linter rules)
- C#, Swift library docs (low adoption)

---

## Notes
- All "copyable" pages (Icons, Tokens, Illustrations) use consistent TokenCard component
- Component detail modals use neutral-0 background
- Getting Started and Contributing use secondary sidebar navigation
- Brand is a hub page with category cards (not sidebar nav)
